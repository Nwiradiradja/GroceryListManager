# Project Plan
**Author**: Nathaniel Wiradiradja
## 1 Introduction
This application allows for users to create and manage grocery lists from the palm of their hand on their mobile device, making shopping for groceries more convenient than ever before.

## 2 Process Description 
**Executive Overview**
* The project "GLM" or Grocery List Manager allows for users to create a list of groceries with features such as adding, deleting, checking and unchecking items from a list, as well as being able to create multiple lists if needed. Users will be able to browse and search for items on the application, selecting items to be added to the list as they search. On the server side items will be located within a database that users will be able to pull from and browse. The objective of this application is to offer paper free list creation while also being able to multitask by searching for and adding items as well as reviewing lists as needed.
* The entrance criteria is a solution to a problem, which in this case is Brad and Janet wanting to swap from a pencil & paper grocery list to a digital one. 
* The exit criteria is discussion of a plan to convert from pencil & paper to digital. We will know it is complete when a plan has been made to solve this problem which in this case is a mobile app.

**Project Scoping**
* The scope of the project entails giving the user the ability to search for and add items to a list, as well as being able to input items into a database they can search from. The objective of the project does not include being able to purchase products as if it was an online shop.
* The entrance criteria is understanding how the design would work conceptually. Without looking at a physical approach to the application, we first need to go through the process of transferring from a conceptual perspective to a logical perspective and then to the technical side of things in a physical perspective.
* The exit criteria is completing the application's development in a conceptual approach. 

**Requirements**
* The "GLM" app must include the following:
* The ability to create a list.
* The ability to delete a list.
* The ability to rename a list.
* The ability to enter a list.
* The ability to create multiple lists.
* The ability to find and search for items off of keywords.
* The ability to display similar items for a query when searching within the database.
* The ability to save new items by input into the database.
* The ability for a user to add items to a list.
* The ability for a user to delete items from a list.
* The ability for a user to change the quantity of items in a list.
* The ability for a user to check-off items in a list.
* The ability for a user to uncheck items from a list.
* The ability for a user to clear off all check-marked items in a list.
* The entrance criteria is inputting different requirements for users to do in order to operate the application.
* The exit criteria is establishing a list of with set criterias for users to follow.

**Analysis & Design**
* The analysis & design is a review of the diagrams created. We analyze components of the diagram and figure out technical implementations where the transition from designing to coding would be smooth. In addition to making necessary adjustments as the process of developing and designing the product required different drafts.
* The entrance criteria is the creation of the use case diagrams, other diagrams such as the component diagram, sequence diagram, and UML models.
* The exit criteria results in the UI where we take the diagrams created and implement them into a UI where it matches with other diagrams created.

**Implementation**
* The implementation of the plan is incremental starting off from the UML diagram created for Assignment 5. We then move on to the UseCaseModel diagram created, we then need to be able to classify business objects within the system. An example for a business object would be the user, as they will be able to interact with different functions of the system. With the two diagrams in mind we can then look into front end development which includes a user interface and consider how the application will be presented and configured to attract users. Moving on to the activities of the application with the usage of android studio, creating different activities with different purposes for the user. The implementation of the GLM app will connect to a database where information for items including names and types will be stored.
* The entrance criteria is inputting all developmental work such as UML Diagrams, case diagrams, other diagrams, and transitioning it to a technical aspect which includes establishing a database and server.
* The exit criteria is a working application that follows the business objective and a running server with a database storing the information.

**Test**
* The test portion of the plan is a listing of different possible inputs for the application where the team can analyze and work through any potential bugs or other issues. As we list possible inputs we test to see whether their corresponding outputs are satisfactory.
* The entrance criteria is the use case diagram as well as the code.
* The exit criteria is the completed code and the Android APK file.

**Deployment**
* The deployment portion of the plan is the finalized product of the application. This is where the deployment diagram is incorporated and based off the application created, a user manual will be published which instructs on how to use the application and its features to other users. Throughout the process there have been many steps involved as well as multiple drafts and revisions, the deployment step is somewhat of a final review before the official release for any user.
* The entrance criteria is the deployment diagram and user manual.
* The exit criteria is the finalized working application ready to be published.
